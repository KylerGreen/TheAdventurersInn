\"Arrow Keys\" - Move your character

As you explore the dungeon, you'll come across enemies that 
oppose your progress. In these instances you will use your deck
of cards to fight them off. You will place both an action in 
the action slot and a reaction in the reaction slot on your turn.

Good luck on your escape from the dungeon!"
